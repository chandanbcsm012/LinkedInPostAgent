At the same time, this feels, from miles away, soulless and wildly uninteresting. That being said, no one ever offered me $100mm as a signing bonus so who knows what I'd do. Leo Polovets / @lpolovets : Meta paying up for OpenAI engs is fascinating. Founders get questions like what if Google copies you? or what if they offer your key eng $5m? These used to be hypothetical. Now Meta might be starting a trend where big co's recognize that some hires are literally priceless. @antimimetics : It's funny that two Thiel protgs (Altman and Zuckerberg) are competing against each other. I thought only losers did that. @distributionat : Hearing about more senior departures for meta from all labs, will probably be public next week. Intense pressure on leadership at all labs to retain talent, with the usual suspects feeling heat the most Daniel Gross / @danielgross : Ilya and Daniel have assembled an incredible team and I'm honored to have been able to assist in getting SSI off the ground. The company's future is very bright, and I expect miracles to follow. Derya Unutmaz / @deryatr_ : A rare post from Ilya, Daniel Gross is out (likely heading to Meta), & SSI is now focused on developing superintelligence. On this occasion, I'm revising my estimate for achieving ASI from 2030 to 2029, less than four years away. This is the endgame in the age of intelligence.

We are grateful for his early contributions to the company and wish him well in his next endeavor. I am now formally CEO of SSI, and Daniel Levy is President. The technical team continues to report to me. You might have heard rumors of companies looking to acquire us. We are flattered by their attention but are focused on seeing our work through. Sharoon Babu / @sharoonbabu : Ilya Sutskever, cofounder of OpenAI, is now leading his own startup, Safe Superintelligence, after Meta poached his CEO. Talent wars are heating up, AI safety is now competing directly with platform giants for top minds. Pete / @pdt2211 : @rapha_gl Very bearish. It shows that 1. Ilya is not a leader (most researchers struggle at this) 2. SSI has nothing if NFDG assets are being sold for the move to Meta Bindu Reddy / @bindureddy : Ilya is now the CEO, CTO, and CSO of SSI. His $32B AI start-up that has no product, no revenue, and no legit website Now that's some real market power!!  Meir Lakhovsky / @meirl : @danielgross Too many Daniels make the first sentence confusing. Kinda has a Soham vibe Matthew Berman / @matthewberman : Ilya announces the resignation of Daniel Gross.

And who benefits from this most? Well, it won't be the people losing their jobs, that's for sure. It'll be Theresa Payton / @trackerpayton : @unusual_whales Tech is my passion, but let's be realnew tech fails, often spectacularly.

[image] @rogersbase : The cancellations of Perfect Dark & Rare's new IP have solidifed that I'll never own a Xbox again (though I haven't since 360) Nintendo + PC + PlayStation lets me play everything and, quite frankly, it's only a matter of time before GamePass shows up on the other consoles now. @jptellsyou : Keep in mind, Xbox cancelled 2 games and is set to release 12 games while Playstation cancelled 12 games and is set to release 2.

How does one trust this company moving forward?! This all sounds horrible. And it sounds like every studio is being run into the ground. Great Xbox leadership! Jon Clarke / @_sikamikanico_ : I think the biggest problem a company like Microsoft has is a complete inability to enable and empower a creative-led industry against the financial desires of the corporation. I fear that for Xbox, especially post giant acquisitions, this will always be the case. @wario64 : Many of Xbox's subsidiaries are getting hit by the layoffs this morning, including Call of Duty studios such as Raven. Big cuts at Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 - nearly 50% of staff, per source. [image] @stealth40k : A staff memo from Matt Booty confirms that Perfect Dark and Everwild are cancelled. Team Xbox has 40 games in development. Following Phil's note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units. We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. Tom Warren / @tomwarren : more on the Xbox layoffs. Microsoft has cut the head of its Xbox Family and child safety team, as well as gutting its key Xbox user research roles https://www.theverge.com/... @mr_rebs_ : Here's more information from Engadget who spoke to a Halo Studios developer: At least 5 employees were laid off, they received an invite to a meeting with organization leaders, and two (very long) hours later, the Teams call began. The mood at the studio is tense, especially Impurrator Frank / @eyyitsfranklin : @coopercooperco Weird position where they're trying to switch to being a publisher who occasionally makes hardware but don't think the other two will ever allow Game Pass which is the basket Xbox wants to put its eggs in @evankazoocovers : I have been a halo fan since I got my Xbox in 2014. If Microsoft makes Halo Studios use AI to replace voice actors, or if Halo Studios decides to use AI of their own volition, I will not support any game that comes out until voice actors and actresses are given their jobs back. Maku / @tropicalmaku : I am absolutely disappointed with Xbox and Microsoft. So many people ended up losing their jobs, while their leaders continued to have theirs. Remember when Iwata took a 50% pay cut just to avoid company layoffs? Thats what you call a real leader. @kelskiyt : >Halo Studios hit with lay offs >One of their projects was already close to cancellation >General morale is very low >Huge AI push to replace jobs I feel such apathy towards Xbox and Halo at this point. Hard to even be mad, I just feel... nothing What is happening man  @cromwelp : Just a giant black hole sucking everything in, and spitting out bones. While I'm excited for more games, it's important to remember that behind all the PR and hype is the simple truth that they bought portfolios, not people. When you're bought, they're not buying *you*. Zaid Jilani / @zaidjilani : Microsoft's consolidation over the gaming industry is a disaster, they buy up studios, force them to make sequel bait, destroy them. Should've never let them buy Activision either. @bringbackbanjok : Microsoft buying Rare was the single worst thing to ever happen to the gaming industry @iloveairbagged : Microsoft has a genuine talent in completely fumbling all of Rare's IPs @kiwitalkz : Retro Studios released no games between Tropical Freeze(2014) and MPR(2023) and no layoffs, they're now about to release a GOTY contender with Metroid Prime 4. Devs arent going to work at 100% productivity when they have to worry about layoffs, Microsoft are asinine. @photoshop_gy : Remember when Microsoft kept buying up all these game studios and people thought they were gonna save the gaming industry? @ultimashadowx : Every other day Microsoft's sheer continued incompetence never ceases to amaze me. @kaiserbeamz : Microsoft utterly failing out of the games business would be a lot funnier had they not spent the past 15 years buying up a third of the industry. @synthpotato : Microsoft and Xbox buying up so many studios just to cancel games, lay off a ton of their employees and slowly gut their entire identities is frankly everything wrong with this industry.

MickieMorganfield / @mickiedances : www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/u... In licensing otherwise illegal conduct, Trump set a precedent expanding executive power. Bondi letters to tech companies have Trump nullifying a statute banning TikTok Congress passed with bipartisan majorities in 2024, unanimously upheld by SCOTUS. Jeff Sabin / @texanokie07 : As Trump has clearly initiated (see, e.g., TikTok, impoundments, agency shuttering/reorganizations), laws have no meaning if the executive refuses to enforce them. Erich Luepke / @erichluepke : So it seems Trump is allowing TikTok to exist because they serve his political interests? Chris Geidner / @chrisgeidner : Bondi's reasoning if you can call it that, is, essentially, the end of separation of powers. There is not just a unitary executive  there is a unitary government.  Congress's determination in the TikTok law  signed by the president and upheld by SCOTUS  is meaningless if Trump says otherwise.  Henry / @henrythedog : I get that people don't want to enforce the TikTok ban for uh reasons, but its like SUPER fucking bad to have the law be whatever Trump feels like Nero Wolfe / @nero-wolfe : I had much the same reaction, but it only works if both Google and Apple agree. If one defects, then the other will coordinate with TikTok to drive users to it. It would be a PR nightmare because they'd also have Trump using the bully pulpit against them, creator sob stories going viral, etc. X: Michael A.

No. We'd rather you have NOTHING than have AI. @kiakuromivt : @Fazzulouss52098 @nyamimii No she's saying that if you're resorting to using AI because you are poor you shouldnt vtube.

Also there is no verification that Robinhood actually owns the shares, and the IOU may not work. Matt Rosoff / @mattrosoff : Golden age of fraud: The real prize is that if you utter the magic word tokenized, that could let you sell private stock to the general public. It could let companies sell stock to the general public without complying with US disclosure rules. www.bloomberg.com/opinion/news... Ed Zitron / @edzitron.com : Okay, so Oracle claims to have signed an unnamed $30bn-a-year customer that would bring in revenue starting in 2028. It basically has to be OpenAI, right? They're the only tenant in Abilene's Stargate data center. Quick question: how does OpenAI afford that?  archive.is/RFs3h [image] X: @openainewsroom : These OpenAI tokens are not OpenAI equity. We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it. Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approvalwe did not approve any transfer. Please be careful. Tom Schmidt / @tomhschmidt : not sure why anyone thought any differently ... the Robinhood docs are pretty clear that you're buying a *derivative* that is *not* redeemable for the underlying and not backed 1:1 you're just buying an OpenAI forward that Robinhood can redeem on your behalf at any point lol [image] @s4mmyeth : It makes sense that there's probably indirect exposure to the underlying private shares through a third party agreement ( like this) However probably a legal disclaimer from OpenAI should their be a dispute around ownership, as ultimately entitled to the name on the share @teslaart3 : @amitisinvesting ... The point to be careful about is that any LP needs openAI's permission to transfer their shares. This is a gray area since the shares aren't technically transferring but I could see this being contested and decided in court or SEC. @waymoproblems : @MaartenDik @RobinhoodComms Yea it's legit. They're phantom shares. The issue is OpenAI is a non-profit which means they should have never been allowed to issue private equity to begin with but that will prob change now that they've had their entire team poached by meta because of this issue @merts_eth : @solidintel_x Doesnt matter its a free market and they're synthetic tokens Imagine being some HNWI holding early OpenAI shares and now your exit liquidity is a French college student buying sOPENAI on Arbitrum. This is either the most efficient capital unlock in history or a legal black hole [image] Chris / @chatgpt21 : I'm actually proud for what RobinHood is doing here actually sticking to the name of the company.
